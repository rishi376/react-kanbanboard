# React + TypeScript

## Project link: https://rishi-kanban-react.netlify.app/

This application creates a task manager using kanban.
Task manager has 3 status TODO, INPROGRESS, DONE.

This is project is an assignment given for an interview.

You can add new task, delete task, drag a task to another card making it change status automatically. That is if todo task is dragged to done card, todo task is removed from todo card and placed onto done task card also updating the status of the task.

This project is not fully completed yet

## TODO
1. Make the cards edittable allowing users to edit the task name.
2. Make the app support on mobile apps.
3. Allow users to add task name before adding a new task, currently the task name is hardcoded for every new add.
4. Use clean state management like context api.
